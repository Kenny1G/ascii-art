# Ascii-art
Ascii art is a image to ASCII converter created in java. It is based on [Robert Heaton's Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners](https://robertheaton.com/2018/06/12/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners-ascii-art/) but it uses a gui rather than the command line as I am still trying to learn java swing in preparation for my next semester.
