# ascii-art
Ascii art is a image to ASCII converter created in java. It is based on [Robert Heaton's Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners] (https://robertheaton.com/2018/06/12/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners-ascii-art/) but it is a gui rather than command line as I am still trying to learn swing in preparation for my next semester.
