# Ascii-art
Ascii art is a image to ASCII converter created in java 11. It is based on [Robert Heaton's Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners](https://robertheaton.com/2018/06/12/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners-ascii-art/) but uses a UI where Roberts is based on the command line
# How To Use
The program can be run easiest by importing and running it on the intellij idea ide, it can also be run from the command line by going to the target/classes folder and running ``` java Main ``` I believe it can run on all other ide's but I don't use them so I am not sure how, though I think it would be an easy import.
